This is a project that's part of the Full-Stack Web Developers Nano Degree program that I am enrolled in with Udacity.com.

It's a simple dynamically generated HTML website written in python that displays and plays a selection of movies trailers.

To install and run the python program do the following:

- Download the following (3) files onto your computer:
    classic_movies.py
    media.py
    movie_trailer_repository.py

- All (3) of the above python files must be installed in the same directory in order for the website to work properly.

- To run the python program and generate the HTML website, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you placed the above files.

- Type or cut and paster the following line of code:

    python movie_trailer_repository

Click enter and your default web browser will be invoked and the movie website will load. Just click on any of the movie posters to view their respective theatrical trailers.

I plan on adding many new features and movies to this site in the near future.
